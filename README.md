# odin-recipes

## Introduction

This is the first project of [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com).

The goal is to use all that I've learned previously by creating a recipes website. It will probably be a bit ugly because there is no CSS involved. This is what I should use in this website : 

1. html boilerplate
2. html file organization
3. html tags
```html
    <a href=""></a>
    <img src="" alt="">
    <h1>....<h99>
    <ul>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li></li>
    </ol>    
``` 
Let's check this out. The conclusion will be written after realising the project !
